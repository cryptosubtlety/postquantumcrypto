### FAQs ###
I’ve been asked a few times whether certain descriptions are mathematically accurate and why some details are left out. I want to explain the context and constraints that I had when writing these articles. I hope to achieve 2 goals:

- Don’t avoid maths but use the least possible advanced math concepts.
- Focus on high-level and core ideas.

It’s difficult to choose the right the trade-off between mathematical accuracy and intuitive understanding. Furthermore, in contrast to my previous article https://github.com/cryptosubtlety/intuitive-advanced-cryptography, quantum computation and post-quantum cryptography is kind of low-level, i.e., they don’t tie directly to  real-world applications, so it’s tough to describe them. In short, I don’t have a good answer to your questions :) I’m aware that the articles reflect my level of intuition and it might not match your intuition.
